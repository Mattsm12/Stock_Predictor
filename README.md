# Stock_Predictor
This project is used to predict the next 30 days of stock and whether the overall
change of the price in stock increases, decreases or stays stagnant. It graphs the predicted adjusted closing prices of the 
stock at the end of each predicted day and as well as a graph of the overall change from day 1 to day 30 in stock price. It
also shows the average price of the stock within the month. The project works by inputting the stock you want in the preferable 
form of WIKI/insert stock name.
If the program has the error: ("DeprecationWarning: the imp module is deprecated in favour of importlib; 
see the module's documentation for alternative uses import imp") please delete import imp from cloudpickle for the time being 
This is my first project on machine learning and was inspired by the video  tutorials sklearn series by sentdex.
